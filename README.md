## Loading assets

Place your assets in `bin/data/`. Your game is small enough for all your assets to fit in RAM. For this reason, we are going to load all the assets at once and keep them loaded until your game exits.

Your assets should be defined in code in [`src/assets.h`](src/assets.h) as global objects inside the `Assets` namespace, and should be loaded in [`src/assets.cpp`](src/assets.cpp) inside the `Assets::LoadAll()` function.

The following are all the supported assets types and how to load and store them:

### Images: `GPU_Texture*`

All your images must be in PNG format. Use [`LoadImage("<path>")`](engine/asset_load.h) to load them into a `GPU_Texture*` that you will use to draw later.

### Sound effects: [`Sound`](engine/sound.h)

All your sounds must be either OGG or WAV. Define your sound effects as `static inline` instances of the [`Sound`](engine/sound.h) class and use its `sound.Load("<path>")` method to load them.

There's also a [`MultiSound`](engine/sound.h) class that takes an array of paths and each time will play one of them at random.

### Music: `Mix_Music*`

All your music files must be in OGG format. Use [`LoadMusic("<path>")`](engine/asset_load.h) to load them into a `Mix_Music*`.

### Fonts: `TTF_Font*`

TTF fonts can be used to render strings of text. Use [`LoadFont("<path>", <size>)`](engine/asset_load.h) and [`LoadFontOutline("data/PressStart2P.ttf", <size>, <outline_size>)`](engine/asset_load.h) to load them into a `TTF_Font*`.

Caveats:
 - You will need to store one `TTF_Font*` per font size you want to render text at.
 - You will need two `TTF_Font*` to draw a font with outline. `LoadFontOutline()` loads the outline _only_ so you still need to use `LoadFont()` on the same font path and size and store both `TTF_Font*`.

### Shaders: [`Shader`](engine/shader.h)

Define your shaders as `static inline` instances of the [`Shader`](engine/shader.h) class and use its `shader.Load("<vertex_path>", "<geometry_path>", "<fragment_path>")` method to load, compile and link together up to a vertex, geometry and frament shaders.

Don't include `#version` or `precision` directives in your shaders, depending on where your game runs we will pick these for you (and hope it compiles).

If any path is `nullptr`, a default shader will be loaded in its place.

## Drawing on screen: part one (the basics)

### Drawing images

To draw an asset you have loaded somewhere in the world, call [`Window::Draw(Assets::<my_asset>, <position>)`](engine/window_draw.h) and optionally chain any transformations you want. Eg:
```C++
vec position = vec(0,0);
Window::Draw(Assets::mySprite, position)
	.withRotationDegs(45)
	.withScale(4);
```

Find all the supported transformations in the definition of `Window::Draw` in [`engine/window_draw.h`](engine/window_draw.h) file.

### Spritesheets and animated sprites

It is possible to draw only a portion of an image, which lets you use spritesheets. The follow code will draw a rectangle of 16*16 pixels starting at (`32,32`) from `Assets::mySprite` on the top left corner of the screen:

```C++
Window::Draw(Assets::mySprite, vec(0,0))
	.withRect(32,32,16,16);
```

A common use for spritesheets are sprite animations. You can use the [`Animation`](engine/animation.h) class to play them.

First, create an array of [`AnimationFrame`](engine/animation.h), with the spritesheet coordinates and the duration of each frame (in seconds):

```C++
constexpr const AnimationFrame EnemyWalkingFrames[] = {
	{ {  0, 0, 32, 32 }, 0.1f },
	{ { 32, 0, 32, 32 }, 0.1f },
	{ { 64, 0, 32, 32 }, 0.1f },
	{ { 96, 0, 32, 32 }, 0.3f },
};
```

Then create an `Animation` object:

```C++
Animation animation(EnemyWalkingFrames);
```

You must update the animation each frame:

```C++
animation.Update(dt);
```

And finally use it to find the current frame to draw:

```C++
Window::Draw(Assets::mySprite, vec(0,0))
	.withRect(animation.CurrentFrameRect());
```

You can also change the animation that is playing without any additional changes to your `Draw` function, by using `anim.Set(newAnimFrames)` or `anim.Ensure(newAnimFrames)`. Check the [`engine/animation.h`](engine/animation.h) header for everything `Animation` can do.

### Rendering text

Use the `TTF_Font*` from `Assets` to instantiate the [`Text`](engine/text.h) class, set the string you want to draw and then draw it the same way as an image:

```C++
Text myText(Assets::myAwesomeFont);
myText.SetFillColor(255,128,128);
myText.SetString("my cool string");
Window::Draw(myText, <position>);
```

Keep your `Text` instances in scope instead of recreating them each frame, since rendering a string is expensive.

If you want to render a string with an outline, you will have to pass two `TTF_Font*` to the `Text` constructor.

You can use `SetFillColor(...)` and `SetOutlineColor(...)` to change the color of your text.

You can also draw strings containing newlines. Use `SetMultilineAlignment(...)`, `SetMultilineSpacing(...)` and `SetEmptyLinesMultilineSpacing(...)` to tweak how they are rendered.

### Clearing the window

Unless you are going to draw to every single pixel in you scene's `Draw` method, you probably want to clear the previous image with a solid background color before drawing the new one. Use `Window::Clear(r,g,b)` as defined in [`engine/window.h`](engine/window.h).

### The camera

The default camera has the top left corner at `(0,0)`.

To move it arround, use the `Camera::SetCenter()` and  `Camera::SetTopLeft()` functions, defined in [`engine/camera.h`](engine/camera.h).

The [`Camera`](engine/camera.h) class also provides functions to zoom in and out, rotate the camera, as well as getting the current position, zoom and rotation.

#### Camera for GUIs

It's common to have GUI elements on screen that shouldn't be affected by the camera movement, zoom or rotation. You can draw without applying any camera transformations by placing your `Window::Draw` calls between `Camera::InScreenCoords::Begin()` and `Camera::InScreenCoords::End()`.

## Scenes

### The Scene class

Games are split in scenes. All scenes should inherit from the [`Scene`](engine/scene.h) class and implement these methods:

 - `Update(float dt)` will be called once per frame, so you can move your things around. `dt` is the time in seconds since the last frame (capped if too high) so you can make movement time-dependent and not framerate-dependent.
 - `Draw() const` will be called after `Update()` and is where you should put your calls to `Window::Draw` (see "Drawing Images" below).
 - `EnterScene()` and `ExitScene()` will be called before/after the `Update` and `Draw` functions first start/stop being called, respectively. This is different that the constructor given that you could have more than one `Scene` instantiated, but only one running.

### EntryPointScene

When the game starts, it will load the `EntryPointScene` you have defined in [`src/scene_entrypoint.h`](src/scene_entrypoint.h). `EntryPointScene` is meant to be a `typedef` to your actual scene class (unless you want to name your scene `EntryPointScene`).

### Changing scenes: [`SceneManager`](engine/scene_manager.h)

Use `SceneManager::ChangeScene(new MyAwesomeScene())` to change to a new scene and `SceneManager::RestartScene()` to re-enter the current one.

Note the constructor of the new scene runs right away, while the current scene is still active. Because of this, don't put your scene initialization logic in the scene constructor (use `EnterScene` for that), and specifically don't instantiate any self-registering (see below) entities there, since they would show up from your current scene.

## Entities and SelfRegister

You can organize your game code however you like but, if I were you, I would define classes for my different game entities (enemies, powerups, bullets, player...) and make them extend `Entity` and `SelfRegister`.

Inheriting `MyClass` from `SelfRegister<MyClass>`, will give you a `MyClass::GetAll()` method that will return all the instances of `MyClass` you have created (and not destroyed yet). Use it as follows:

```C++
new Enemy(1);
new Enemy(2); // No need to store these anywhere

for (Enemy* e : Enemy::GetAll()) {
	e->Update(dt);
}
```

`SelfRegister<MyClass>` also provides the `MyClass::DeleteAll()` and `MyClass::DeleteNotAlive()` methods, meant to be used on `ExitScene` and at the end of each frame, respectively. To use `DeleteNotAlive` your class must contain an `alive` boolean, and will destroy your objects if it is `true`. Waiting to delete your entities until the end of the frame can help you avoid use-after-free bugs: just make sure to let go any pointers to entities where `alive` is `false`.

Inheriting from `Entity` already gives you an `alive` boolean in your class, as well as two vectors `pos` and `vel` (which you probably want to have on all objects). It's a good idea to edit this class to add any other properties in common to all your game entities.

## Points and vectors: the [`vec`](engine/vec.h) struct

You will be using lots of (x,y) pairs when making your game. If you are lazy like me, you will appreciate this struct is only 3 letters long.

The `vec` struct has all the goodies you might want: `+`, `-`, `/` and `*` operators, methods to rotate, normalize, get the lenght... See the definitions in the [`engine/vec.h`](engine/vec.h) header.

When your functions take `vec` as arguments, pass them by value.

## Bounding boxes and collisions

The collision primitives are rectangles (`BoxBounds`) and circles (`CircleBounds`), both defined in [`engine/bounds.h`](engine/bounds.h).

- `BoxBounds` are defined by a position (from their top-left) and a size. Use `BoxBounds::FromCenter(center, size)` to specify the center point instead of the top-left when creating it.
- `CircleBounds` are defined by a center position and a radius.

### BoxEntity and CircleEntity

`BoxEntity` and `CircleEntity` (defined in [`engine/entity.h`](engine/entity.h)) are subclasses of the `Entity` class which provide a `Bounds()` method that returns a `BoxBounds` or `CircleBounds` respectively, centered on the position of the `Entity`. This is useful so you don't have to keep in sync the position of an `Entity` and its bounds.

### Collisions

Use the `Collide(a,b)` function defined in [`engine/collide.h`](engine/collide.h) to check if two bounds or two `BoxEntity`/`CircleEntity` collide. See this example, which makes use of `SelfRegister` class to check if any `Enemy` collides with any `Bullet`:

```C++
for (Bullet* bullet, Bullet::GetAll())
{
	for (Enemy* enemy, Enemy::GetAll())
	{
		if (Collide(bullet, enemy))
		{
			enemy->HitByBullet(bullet);
		}
	}
}
```

If you are into the brevity thing, a more compact way to achieve the same result is using the `CollideWithCallback(...)` method which takes both sets of objects as returned by `GetAll()` and a lambda:

```C++
CollideWithCallback(Bullet::GetAll(), Enemy::GetAll(), [](Bullet* bullet, Enemy* enemy)
{
	enemy->HitByBullet(bullet);
});
```

#### Collisions within entities of the same class

When checking collisions between objects of the same class, use `CollideSelf(...)` like this:

```C++
CollideSelf(Enemy::GetAll(), [](Enemy* enemy_a, Enemy* enemy_b)
{
	enemy_a->HitOtherEnemy(enemy_b);
	enemy_b->HitOtherEnemy(enemy_a);
});
```

This skips checking both `Collide(a,b)` and `Collide(b,a)` for the same pair of objects, which is faster.

## Input

### Actions-based input

The Input class is an abstraction over the different input methods which uses actions (eg: "jump", "move left") as your input events. Each action can then be mapped to keys on a gamepad, keyboard and/or mouse for each player.

Define your game actions in the `GameKeys` enum in [`src/input_conf.h`](src/input_conf.h) and initialize the mapping in `MapGameKeys` in [`src/input_conf.cpp`](src/input_conf.cpp). The mapping consists of an array of `std::functions` indexed by `GameKeys`, where each function should return true if the given action key/button is pressed. See the next sections about how to query each separate input method.

Eg:

```C++
action_mapping[(int)GameKeys::JUMP] = [](int p) // p is the player number, 0-based
{
	// Gamepad: jump with X or joystick up
	if (GamePad::IsButtonPressed(p, SDL_CONTROLLER_BUTTON_X) ||
		GamePad::AnalogStick::Left.get(p).y < -50.0f) {
			return true;
	}
	if (p == 0) {
		// Player 1 keyboard: jump with W
		return Keyboard::IsKeyPressed(SDL_SCANCODE_W);
	} else {
		// Player 2 keyboard: jump with arrow up
		return Keyboard::IsKeyPressed(SDL_SCANCODE_UP);
	}
};
```

To query if an action is being pressed, use the `Input` class defined in [`engine/input.h`](engine/input.h):

```C++
if (Input::IsJustPressed(player, GameKeys::Jump)) {
	// ...
}
```

Check the [`engine/input.h`](engine/input.h) header for everything `Input` can do.

### Keyboard input

The `Keyboard` struct is defined in [`engine/raw_input.h`](engine/raw_input.h). It contains the `IsKeyPressed`, `IsKeyJustPressed`, `IsKeyReleased` and `IsKeyJustReleased` static functions, which take an [`SDL_Scancode`](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode) and return a `bool`.

### Mouse input

The `Mouse` struct is defined in [`engine/raw_input.h`](engine/raw_input.h). It contains functions to access the buttons, scrollwheel and cursor position. The position can be queried both in world coordinates (affected by the camera position and zoom) or in window coordinates (in virtual, scaled pixels, between `0,0` and `GAME_WIDTH,GAME_HEIGHT`).

### GamePad input

The `GamePad` struct is defined in [`engine/raw_input.h`](engine/raw_input.h). It contains functions to access the buttons (given as [`SDL_GameControllerButton`](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GameControllerButton)) as well as the position of analog joytsticks (as `GamePad::AnalogStick::Left` and `GamePad::AnalogStick::Right`) and triggers (as `GamePad::Trigger::Left` and `GamePad::Trigger::Right`).

## Random

The `Rand` and `GoodRand` namespaces defined in in [`engine/rand.h`](engine/rand.h) provide a source of RNG for your speedruners to hate.

`Rand` is faster but "less random" than `GoodRand`: use the second if making something serious like a poker game where people play with real money.

The `Rand::OnceEvery(n)` and `Rand::PercentChance(percentage)` functions are very expresive and awesome, use them. You also have `Rand::VecInRange` and `Rand::DirInCircle` functions which return a `vec`.

## Playing sounds and music

To play a sound just call `Assets::mySound.Play()`. Sounds also have a `SetVolume(<0-100>)` method you can use. See [`engine/sound.h`](engine/sound.h).

You can also use `PlayInLoop()` to play something forever and play positional audio with `Play(vec source, vec listener, float silenceDistance)`.

The family of `Play` functions all return a channel id. Store that id to then call `Sound::Stop(channel)` and `Sound::Playing(channel)`.

By default SDL_Mixer allocates 8 channels, which means that up to 8 sounds can play simultaneously.

To play a music track, use `MusicPlayer::Play(Assets::myMusic)`. Note only one music track can play at a time. The current track can be controlled with `MusicPlayer::Pause()`, `MusicPlayer::Resume()` and `MusicPlayer::Stop()` and the volume adjusted with `MusicPlayer::SetVolume(<0-100>)`. See [`engine/musicplayer.h`](engine/musicplayer.h).

## Drawing on screen: part two (the advanced stuff)

### Particle systems

The [`PartSys`](engine/partsys.h) class implements a simple particle system.

The constructor `PartSys(GPU_Image* texture)` takes a spritesheet that should contain all the particles. The specific positions of the particle sprites withing the spritesheet are indicated with `AddSprite(const GPU_Rect& rect)`. 

Particles can be spawned based on a timer using `partSys.Spawn(float dt)` and `partSys.SpawnWithExternalTimer(float& timer, float dt)` or manually using `AddParticle()` and `AddParticles(int n)`.

The [`PartSys`](engine/partsys.h) class contains a bunch of public fields that let you configure the range of velocities, accelerations, scales, etc that particles will be spawned with. You should set these fields directly after instantiating the class.

Finally, you should `partSys.Draw()` your particle system. `PartSys` is a `SelfRegister` class, so you can use `PartSys::GetAll()` to iterate through your particle systems.

To test different values without having to rebuild you game after each change, you can use `partSys.DrawImGUI()` to draw an interactive ImGUI window which lets you change all the parameters at runtime (but doesn't store them, you still need to set them by code).

### `DeferredDraw`

Use `Window::DeferredDraw` instead of `Windows::Draw` to get yourself an object you can draw at a later moment in time. This is useful, for example, to simulate perspective by sorting all your draw calls by their Y coordinate before actually drawing them, so things that are closer to the camera are drawn on top. `DeferredDraw` has the same interface as `Draw` but won't actually draw anything on screen until you manually call its `.Draw()` method.

```C++
auto a = Window::DeferredDraw(...);
auto b = Window::DeferredDraw(...);
b.Draw();
a.Draw();
```

### Tile maps

TODO

### Using shaders

To activate a shader call `Assets::myShader.Activate()`.

You can pass uniforms to the active shader with `Assets::myShader.SetUniform(...)`. See [`engine/shader.h`](engine/shader.h).

Only one shader can be active at a time. You can go back to the default shader by calling `Shader::Deactivate()`.

### Render to texture and fullscreen shaders

To apply a fullscreen shader, render the whole scene as a render-to-texture, then render the resulting texture applying the shader.

The following examples assume you want your render-to-texture texture be the size of the game window (like you would to apply a fullscreen shader), but you can do a render-to-texture of any size.

* Use `GPU_Texture* myTexture = Window::CreateTexture(Window::GAME_WIDTH, Window::GAME_HEIGHT)` to create a new empty texture.
* Set the texture you created as the render target with `Window::BeginRenderToTexture(myTexture)`.
* Use `Window::Draw` calls as normal. They will be rendered to `myTexture`.
* When done, use `Window::EndRenderToTexture()` to resume drawing to the screen.
* Finally, draw your generated texture normally like `Window::Draw(myTexture, Camera::TopLeft())`.

Note: Since `Window::CreateTexture` takes sizes in virtual pixels, you should recreate your base texture everytime `Window::GetViewportScale()` changes. Remember to free the previous texture with `Window::DestroyTexture(myTexture)` when creating a new one.

### Screenshake

While there's no ready-made screenshake function, the `Camera` namespace contains a `screenshake_offset` variable that you can update and gets added to your camera each time you set its position, without affecting the returned camera position when you get it. This should make implementing a screenshake effect easy. 

If you are not setting the camera position each frame, make sure to add a call like `Camera::SetCenter(Camera::Center());` to make sure the offset is applied after you set it.

### Drawing primitives

The `Window::DrawPrimitive` namespace in [`engine/window_drawprimitive.h`](engine/window_drawprimitive.h) contains functions to draw simple geometric shapes:

- `Window::DrawPrimitive::Pixel(...)`
- `Window::DrawPrimitive::Rectangle(...)`
- `Window::DrawPrimitive::Line(...)`
- `Window::DrawPrimitive::Circle(...)`
- `Window::DrawPrimitive::Arc(...)`

### Drawing raw quads

If you like it hard, you can submit vertex and texture coordinates directly for them to be drawn in batch.

Do so with the following pairs of batch and flush functions, defined in `Window::DrawRaw` in [`engine/window_drawraw.h`](engine/window_drawraw.h):

- `Window::DrawRaw::BatchTexturedQuad(GPU_Image* image, float x, float y, float w, float h, GPU_Rect& texture_coords)` and `Window::DrawRaw::FlushTexturedQuads(GPU_Image* image)` for textured quads.
- `Window::DrawRaw::BatchColoredTexturedQuad(...)` and `Window::DrawRaw::FlushColoredTexturedQuads(...)`. for quads textured & colored .
- `Window::DrawRaw::BatchRGBQuad(...)` and `Window::DrawRaw::FlushRGBQuads()` for untextured quads.

## Save games

The [`SaveState`](engine/savestate.h) class lets you write your game state to persistent storage.

You can get a `SaveState` instance by calling `SaveStance::Open(const char* game_name, int state_num)`. This will load any existing data from it.

Each `SaveState` contains several entries and an abritary number of values per entry. Each entry is meant to store the state of on entity in your game.

Values on an entry can be written and read using stream operators. For example, to write three variables (which could have different types) to an entry called `player_1` you would call:

```C++
saveState.StreamPut("player_1") << player_level << player_health << player_name;
```

Reading the same variables is then possible by doing:

```C++
saveState.StreamGet("player_1") >> player_level >> player_health >> player_name;
```

As usual in C++ streams, if the `player_1` entry is empty, trying to read from it won't overwrite the output variables. This means you can set default values before loading a state and they will be preserved if there's no saved data.

If you hate streams, you can also read and write entries as string key-value pairs by using `saveState.Put(std::string key, std::string value)` and `saveState.Get(std::string key)`.

After you have modified a `SaveState` instance, you can persist the changes to disk by calling `saveState.Save()`.

Note: if you open the same save state twice (ie: passing the same name and number values to `SaveState::Open`), data written to one instance won't be synced to the other!

## Window properties

### Game window size

The size in virtual pixels of the window is defined in [`src/window_conf.h`](src/window_conf.h). Those are virtual, in-game pixels, but the actual window size will be upscaled (preserving the aspect ratio) to the biggest multiple that fits the screen.

### Fullscreen mode

Pressing Alt+Enter will toggle between windowed and fullscreen. You can also do this in code using `Window::SetFullScreen(bool b)` defined in [`engine/window.h`](engine/window.h).

### Window title

The title can be set in [`src/window_conf.h`](src/window_conf.h).

### Hide the mouse cursor

Call `Window::SetShowCursor(bool b)` defined in [`engine/window.h`](engine/window.h) to show and hide the mouse pointer.

## Debug features

### Frame-by-frame

Press F1 to toggle frame-by-frame mode on and off. In this mode, your scene's `Update()` function is not called (but `Draw()` is).

Pressing E while in this mode will cause a single `Update()` to run, so you can advance your game logic one frame at a time. This is also useful to set breakpoints in your `Update()` code, just in the exact frame you want to debug.

Another way to trigger this mode is by manually setting the global [`Debug::FrameByFrame`](engine/debug.h) to `true`. This is useful to enter frame-to-frame mode when a certain event happens in your code.

Note that in Release builds `Debug::FrameByFrame` is always `false` and it can't be changed (it's `const`), so don't try to write to it unless the define `_DEBUG` is set.

### Debug draw mode and DebugDraw functions

Press F2 to toggle the global [`Debug::Draw`](engine/debug.h) boolean on and off.

Add visuals for bounding boxes, invisible triggers, limits, etc. to be only drawn when `Debug::Draw` is `true`, so that you can show and hide them at runtime.

Note that in Release builds, `Debug::Draw` is always `false` and it can't be changed (it's `const`). This allows the compiler to optimize out any code you guard in an `if (Debug::Draw)` from Release builds.

The classes [`vec`](engine/vec.h), `BoxBounds` and `CircleBounds` (defined in [`engine/bounds.h`](engine/bounds.h)) all have a `DebugDraw()` method. Calling `DebugDraw()` will draw an outline of the bounds/vec, only when in `Debug::Draw` mode and after everything else is drawn (so always on top).

In addition, the [`vec`](engine/vec.h) class has `DebugDrawAsArrow()` which takes another `vec` and draws an arrow between the two (useful for directions, forces...).

Note that since `DebugDraw()` calls are queued and drawn at the end of the frame, it doesn't matter where you call them from (eg: you can call `DebugDraw()` from your `Update()` logic). It's also useful to call them from temporary objects, eg: `CircleBounds(pos, triggerRadius).DebugDraw()`.

Both `DebugDraw()` and `DebugDrawAsArrow()` receive an optional color argument to be drawn in.

### Reload assets

Press F4 to call the `LoadAssets()` function before the next frame. The `LoadAssets()` function is meant to read your asset files during the game initialization, but can also be used for hot-reloading asset updates. This allows you to see changes to your art, shaders and other assets without restarting the game.

This does leak memory, but it is only used in debug, so who cares.

### Free camera movement

When both debug draw mode and frame-by-frame mode are enabled, you can move your camera freely with the keyboard arrows <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>←</kbd>, zoom in and out with numpad <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd>, and even rotate it with <kbd>PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>PgDn</kbd>.

### Fast forward

Hold F10 to run the game 3x faster than usual (`dt` is multiplied by 3).

### Imgui

[Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) is included. The best library ever made to create tooling and debug UIs. Use it.

The `ParticleSys` class has a `DrawImGUI()` function that shows an ImGUI window with all the parameters of the particle system, so you can tweak them and see how it looks in-game, before writing them in your code. 

### Printing text

Use the `Debug::out` stream to print to stdout, like you would with `std::cout` but without having to end with `std::endl` (a newline is added automatically).

The classes `vec`, `BoxBounds`, `CircleBounds` and `GPU_Rect` all can be streamed to `Debug::out` and have a text representation.

On Windows, the Debug build of the game will also open a terminal window so you can see the stdout output.

## Importers

Python scripts are provided to generate C++ code from Tiled and TexturePacker projects. By using code generation, you compiler can ensure that all the resources you reference exist (avoiding runtime-only errors), and your IDE can provide code completion for them.
